# Security Camera with Motion Detection

This project is a simple security camera system built using opencv-Python. The system utilizes a webcam to capture footage and detects motion by comparing differences between consecutive frames. When motion is detected, an alarm sounds using the `winsound` library. The project leverages the powerful `opencv` library for video processing and motion detection.

## Features

- **Real-time Motion Detection:** Continuously captures video and compares consecutive frames to detect any motion.
- **Alarm System:** Sounds an alarm using the `winsound` library when motion is detected.
- **Easy Setup:** Simple and straightforward setup using a webcam and Python libraries.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
- Winsound (standard library on Windows)
- time (library for FPS rate)

## Installation
